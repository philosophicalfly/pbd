## Starting a Jupyter notebook on Mac OS using venv

1. Open a terminal on your Mac OS machine.
2. Install Python3 if you haven't already installed it. You can install it by downloading it from the official website https://www.python.org/downloads/ or by using a package manager like Homebrew.
3. Install virtualenv if you haven't already installed it. You can install it by running the following command:

```pip3 install virtualenv```

4. Create a new virtual environment named "myenv" by running the following command:

```python3 -m venv myenv```

5. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:

```source myenv/bin/activate```

6. Install Jupyter notebook inside the virtual environment by running the following command:

```pip install jupyter```

7. Start the Jupyter notebook server by running the following command:

```jupyter notebook```

8. A new tab will open up in your web browser showing the Jupyter notebook interface. You can now create a new notebook or open an existing one.

```http://localhost:8888/tree```

To stop the Jupyter notebook server, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you want to use Jupyter notebook. To do this, simply run the following command:

```source myenv/bin/activate```
